# Weather-Journal App Project
Front Ent Web Developer second project for udacity nanodegree.

## Overview
This project requires you to create an asynchronous web app that uses Web API and user data to dynamically update the UI with 
zip code from input and get users feelings from textarea. 

---

Starter code taken from udacity [repository](https://github.com/udacity/fend/tree/refresh-2019/projects/weather-journal-app).

I use node and express to create server & routes , Initialize the main project folder and using bootstrap.css to use classes and make ui 
responsive. 
 

### Server 
before running local server need install dependencies "Express","Body-parser","Cors".

To run local server from terminal using "node server.js".
